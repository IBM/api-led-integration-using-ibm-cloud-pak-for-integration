# API-led Application Integration with IBM Cloud Pak for Integration

Every enterprise in today's markets must offer robust digital products and services, often requiring integration of complex capabilities and systems to deliver one coherent whole. [IBM Cloud Pak for Integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-pak-integration?topic=cloud-pak-integration-getting-started) offers a simplified solution to this integration challenge, allowing the enterprise to modernize its processes while positioning itself for future innovation. Once installed, IBM Cloud Pak for Integration eases monitoring, maintenance and upgrades, helping the enterprise stay ahead of the innovation curve.

In this series we will demonstrate how to create an API which takes a car repair claim request, complete with a photograph of the car, and integrates with a SaaS CRM system and IBMâ€™s Watson AI to create a car repair case with all the correct details loaded into the SaaS system and data routed to the correct location based on the image contents; all in a few seconds before returning a response to the customer. We will then add API management capabilities to our Integration application, apply security and rate-plans and publish it to Self-Service Portal. We'll show how applications are registered to API server.

The series will consist of two tutorials as follows:

1. Part1 - [Build a Cognitive Car Claim Processing application with ICP4i Integration capabilities](https://github.com/IBM/api-led-integration-using-ibm-cloud-pak-for-integration/tree/master/Application-Integration) and
2. Part2 - [Manage and Secure Cognitive Car Claim Processing API with ICP4i API Lifecycle Management](https://github.com/IBM/api-led-integration-using-ibm-cloud-pak-for-integration/tree/master/API-Management)
